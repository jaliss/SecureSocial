Sample SecureSocial 2 Application (Scala version)
=================================================
To run this sample you need to:

1) Copy the contents of the module-core into the modules/securesocial.  If you are using a unix based
OS you can do a symbolic link instead.

2) Create an application in the developer site of each provider you want to try and configure the OAuth 
settings in the application.conf file.

OAuth2 callback URLs will be constructed as following:

scheme://host:port/authenticate/<providerName>

So in case of Google for example, you would need to set allowed OAuth callback URLs to:

http://localhost:9000/authenticate/google
http://www.yourdomain.com/authenticate/google

to allow development (first line) and production (second line) for HTTP.
