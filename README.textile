h2. Difference from SecureSocial

Main goal of SecSoc is light version of SecureSocial. So SecSoc miss next SecureSocial features:

* Java API. I don't write in Java so can't support it.
* UI support. Authentication UI is good for very quick start. But it also make your project not flexible. For example,
 integrate single page authentication and registration is not possible in standard SecureSocial UI.
* Async support. I removed most of Future from function return to plain. I think that it's very overused in SecureSocial
(may be I'm wrong).

Any way, if you need these features you should take original SecureSocial library.
